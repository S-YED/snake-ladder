# 🎲 Snake and Ladder Game (Java)

Welcome to the classic **Snake and Ladder** game built using Java!  
This is a console-based implementation of the traditional board game, where players roll a dice, move across the board, and try to reach the 100th cell while avoiding snakes and leveraging ladders.



## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Turn-based gameplay for 2 or more players
- 🎲 Simulated dice rolls using Java's `Random` class
- 🐍 Snakes that bring you down the board
- 🪜 Ladders that boost your position
- ✅ Clean OOP structure: `Player`, `Dice`, `Board`, `Snake`, and `Ladder` classes
- 🧠 Handles edge cases like bouncing from cell 99 or landing on the head of a snake
